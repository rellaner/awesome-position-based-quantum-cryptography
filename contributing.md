# Purpose and Goal
This list aims to provide an always up-to-date overview over the academic literature on position-based quantum cryptography (PBQC), a growing field of study within quantum cryptography. The overview is categorised to make the relevance of a paper easily comprehensible. The list should facilitate entering the topic and make the process of getting an overview simple and efficient.

Contributions from the community are welcomed and wanted!

# Contribution Guidelines

When making a **pull request**, please make sure to:
- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.

- Include a link to the resource and briefly describe what it is and why it should be included.
- Add new categories or improve existing categorization when appropriate.
- Within categories, please ensure link names are in chronological order.
- If a paper sits in several categories, include it in each one and only describe the result relevant to the category in its description.
- Have your description:
  - Be short and simple, descriptive and factual, consisting of 1-2 sentences. 
  - Follow this format: `[name (year)](DOI link) - Description.`. If known, the 'year' should be the year in which the paper first appeared online, otherwise the year of peer-reviewed publication. Use the unique DOI link if available. Ideally, the link points to the peer-reviewed version of the paper.
  - Start with a capital and end with a full stop/period; no trailing whitespace.
